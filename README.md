#PHP Club Application Form Assignment
##Collecting and Display Data with PHP and HTML Forms
###Description

Select a club that is (or that **should be**) hosted through Ai. This club would like to put the club application process online. Your job is to create this functional form that collects and displays the club candidates and their application status.

###Tech Requirements

####All forms should collect:
* First and last name (required)
* email address (required)
* Online username (required)
* phone
* Current program here at Ai
* Anticipated grad quarter (IE Fall 2015)

####Club specific information:
You must also collect club-specific data. IE, the Anime club wants to collect member's favorite Anime genre and series, if the member candidate is interested in Anime conventions and/or cosplay, etc.

####Display of collected material
Although all of our collected data will be stored on a public-facing text file, you should have your same php file that collects the form data also display at a minimum:
* username
* first name
* pertinent club data (see Club specific information) 
* membership status of 'pending review'.
_Note: I recommend using a UI pattern such as tabs or an accordion to separate your form and your displayed data._

####Delivery Of Final Code
Final code will be submitted as a pull request to this repository. Code should be submitted as a PR before critique on Tuesday of Week 6.
